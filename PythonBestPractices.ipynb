    "The primary resources for writing style are [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for a general style guide and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstring conventions. These will cover things such as indentations, spacing, comments, naming conventions etc. The guiding principle is that it is read more often than it is written, so readability is the primary end goal of the style guides. \n",

    "Furthermore, examples can be provided within the docstrings that python can run tests against! Implementation is relatively simple using the [doctest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html). This means all the unit tests and the documentation for functions and classes can be written within the code itself. In practice, this helps to acheive the aim of writing tests before or during the writing of the code by integrating the test writing into the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control\n",
    "Using a version control system helps teams to work collaboratively on code. When anyone makes a change to the code, this requires a comment explaining what that change was, and the software will track exactly what changed between the two versions. In practice this means that whenever code breaks, it can be tracked back to a specific change after the last tests were all passed, and then resolved. Version control also allows for branching to release slight adjustments to the code. Bitbucket is the LME's choice for version control, which primarily uses Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good habit to get into is combining your automated testing with your version control, essentially making sure your code works before merging it back into the main \n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Installs/Registrations\n",
    "Using Bitbucket requires the installation of Git on the VDI/Desktop and access to the [LME Bitbucket site](https://bitbucket.lme.co.uk/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the Python Package Index\n",
    "> \"Stuck on a problem? There's a Python Package for that!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For the majority of problems you will come across when coding, there is a package that someone has built to solve that problem. Use these as much as possible, rather than reinventing the wheel yourself. <br>\n",
    "It should be noted that at the time of writing, users only have access to the base packages that ship with Anaconda, and ideally they would be able to experiment using more specialist libraries. In order to do this, there may need to be some process around scanning for CVEs. This can be done using source clear as an initial check.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a virtual environment for each project**. This helps avoid any clashes between libraries, and allows the enviroment to be provided across multiple platforms. If code is run from its virtual environment, it will continue to work regardless of the state of the root environment, so upgrades to packages will not break code or introduce deprecation errors over time. <br>\n",
    "Conda environments should be the go to for Anaconda users. Link to the docs [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html). This ensures that any user can pick up the project and use it without the need to alter their root environment, and can simply activate the environment used in that project. This is key to working collaboratively, and this can be done either from the command line or from the Anaconda GUI. It should be noted that the command line requires separate permissions to allow users to open anaconda prompt or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write Object-Oriented Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language, and everything in Python is an object. using object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable code, also known as DRY (don't repeat yourself). The short version of taking advantage of OOP is to use classes and functions where you can, and the longer version can be found [here](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Know the basic inbuilt data structures that Python has (list, set, dictionary etc) and how to use them. These can be leveraged to help speed up code or simplify in memory data storage. A useful example is data imported in JSON or XML, as this translates well to a mixture of nested lists and dictionaries in Python, but can be difficult to map to a table, particularly with a variety of data types. \n",
